Building package with Rcpp functionality

1. To build/check package, it is 
   R CMD build pkg
   R CMD check pkg

   Also, I can just run R CMD check pkg if I just want to check if it builds okay. 
2. To build and install package at the same time, 
   R CMD INSTALL --build pkg -l ./.
3. To include Rcpp code in DeletionMapping function
   a. Adjust NAMESPACE so that useDynLib(delmap)
   b. Adjust NAMESPACE so that internal function iDeletoinMapping is exported 
      otherwise it cannot find this function when building. 
4. Things to remember with Rcpp file in src directory
   a. Need to include #include "R_ext/Rdynload.h"
   b. Function heading is RcppExport SEXP RcppDeletionMapping(SEXP Arg1, SEXP Arg2 ..){
   c. to include an internal function that is in the package delmap
      Environment delmap("package:delmap");
      Function iDeletionMapping = delmap["iDeletionMapping"];
   d. A list created inside a loop is not visable outside the loop. Therefore 
      if elements are required outside the loop, need to copy it to a global var. 
      This is to do with scoping. 
   e. Use using namespace Rcpp to avoid Rcpp:: for all the function.
