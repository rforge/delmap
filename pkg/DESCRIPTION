Description: Delmap is an R package for mapping genetic markers via genomic deletions. It is assumed that the deletions are frequent, fairly large, and occur randomly throughout a genome. Delmap implements statistical techniqes for using overlapping genomic deletions in inbred lines to order finely genetic markers.  Delmap is not  a tool for genome-wide map construction. Instead, it compliments traditional linkage analysis by providing fine map information for tightly linked marker loci.  The package provides the facility to read, simulate, analyze, and vizualize deletion data.
